  ## How to run the program
  The project contains two diffrent ways of running the simulation, a demo main that runs in ther terminal to outline features that arent present in the GUI, the other way is the GUI   which also includes the game loop which correctly implements the simulation. The demo main/terminal program can be run using the make file present in the System folder. The GUI can 
be run using the make file in the FINAL GUI folder.
